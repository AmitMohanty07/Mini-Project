        <h2>INTRODUCTION TO TROPICAL EVERGREEN FORESTS</h2>
        <p>Tropical Evergreen forests are one of the most dominant parts of Natural vegetation in India. They flourish
            in areas that have rainfall of over 200 cm. Evergreen forests are essential for not only promoting greenery
            on the planet but are also useful in the continual survival of animals and plants in forest ecosystems.
            The tropical evergreen forest in India is essential to the wildlife ecosystem, which is known for providing
            natural habitat to many species of birds, animals, and insects, particularly endangered species such as
            owls, hawks, cardinals, and mammals such as possums, racoons, deer, and others.
            These trees are an important component of Forest Biology and the ecosystem, which helps to promote life in
            the ecosystem.</p>

        <h2> Andaman And Nicobar Islands - Tropical Evergreen Forest</h2>
        <p>The best example of a tropical evergreen forest in India is found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. What
            makes this place all the more special is the large variety of flora and fauna. The Andaman Islands have rare
            plant and animal species that are believed to have passed on from other nearby countries such as Myanmar,
            Thailand, and Bangladesh.

            It is believed that there over 2200 variety of plants grow in the Andaman Islands, making it the richest
            biosphere in India. These tropical rainforests receive on an average a total of 2000 mm of rainfall
            throughout.</p>

        <h2> Assam - Unspoiled Escapes</h2>
        <p>The most isolated, dense, and unspoiled rain forests in India can be found in the Assam region of Northeast
            India. Although the forests are majorly in Northern Assam, traces of the same are found in Nagaland,
            Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura. The rainforests in the Assam region are characterized by low-lying hills that
            have a dense forest cover throughout the year and an average height of 900 meters. This is the most popular
            rainforest in India.

            Overall, Northeast India is famous for its moist sal monsoon forests that can be found in the Assam region
            as well. The region is home to many species of wild monkeys like Rhesus Macaque, Assamese Macaque, Slow
            Loris capped Langurs, Pig-tailed Macaque, Stam-tailed Macaque and Hoolock Gibbons. This rainforest in Assam

        <h2>North Western Ghats Moist Deciduous Forests - Rich in Flora and Fauna</h2>
        <p>Found mostly in Maharashtra and Karnataka, a stretch of moist deciduous forests can be found in the northern
            part of the Western Ghats covering a total area of around 30,000 square kilometres. The rich and dense
            forest cover starts from Southwestern Maharashtra and extends as far as Karnataka and Kerala in South India.

            Another area rich in flora and fauna, Western Ghats are home to more than 1100 species of animals out of
            which more than 200 are endemic to that region. The Western Ghat forest land is also famous for containing
            the largest elephant population in Asia. However, a major concern in this area is the rapid urbanization of
            the forest land as according to the statistics, two-thirds of the original forest land has been cleared or
            deforested. This is one of the famous rainforests in India. </p>

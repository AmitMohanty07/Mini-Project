        <h2>Introduction to Indian Culture & Traditions</h2>
        <p>Indian culture and traditions are something which has now become renowned all across the world. We all refer
            to customs and traditions of India as something very diverse and unique. But seldom do we give a thought to
            why things are done in certain specific ways. Indian culture is full of several unique customs and
            traditions, which outsiders might find intriguing. Most of these originate from the Ancient Indian
            scriptures and texts, which have dictated the way of life in India for thousands of years.</p>

        <h2>Greeting - The Namaste</h2>
        <p>The Namaste, or namaskar, or 'namaskar' is one of the five forms of traditional greetings mentioned in the
            ancient Hindu scriptures, the Vedas. It translates to 'I bow to you', and greeting one another with it is a
            way of saying 'May our minds meet', indicated by the folded palms placed before the chest. The word Namaha
            can also be translated as 'na ma' (not mine), to signify the reductions of one's ego in the presence of the
            other.The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian
            territory anymore. You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or you had Ban
            Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times Square in New York on the
            first International Yoga Day.Namaste is a form of greeting or statement that indicates the doer of
            everything is not me but God. All you need to do is, join both your palm, fingers sticking to each other,
            and a simple bow and say Namaste. This is a very warm type of greeting in India and is practised by most
            individuals when they first meet each other.</p>

        <h2>Festivals & Religion - Always a Festive Season</h2>
        <p>India also sees a large number of festivals, mainly because of the prevalence of diverse religions and
            groups. The Muslims celebrate Eid, the Christians have Christmas and good Friday, the Sikhs have Baisakhi
            (harvesting of crop), and the birthdays of their Gurus and the Hindus have Diwali, Holi, Makar Sakranti, the
            Jains have Mahavir Jayanti, the Buddhists celebrate the Buddha's birthday on Buddha Poornima, and quite

            country like India, life is synonymous with festivals because there are more fiestas than you can count, and
            each of these mirrors our culture and traditions. Breaking the humdrum of daily routine, these festivals
            bring with them a wave of excitement and happiness. Interestingly, almost every big and small occasion in
            India calls for a celebration.Each festival in India has an essence and flavor of its own that you need to
            experience first-hand. We bring to you a hand-picked list of the most popular, vibrant and widely celebrated
            festivals of India that reflect the cultural beauty of this country.</p>

        <h2>Indian Dances -  Natya Shastra</h2>
        <p>India is a land of 'unity in diversity', and our dances are no different. Different forms of dance(classified
            as folk or classical) find origin from different parts of the country, and they are a way of representation
            of the particular culture from which they originate. Eight classical dances, which are classified as Indian
            classical dances and find a mention in the Hindu Sanskrit text 'Natyashashtra', (a text of performing arts)
            are:

            Bharatnatyam from Tamil Nadu
            Kathakali from Kerela
            Kathak from North, West and Central India
            Mohiniyattam from Kerela
            Kuchipudi from Andhra Pradesh
            Oddisi from Odhisa
            Manipuri from Manipur
            Sattriya from Assam.Folk dances mainly trace their importance to the rural areas, where performances depict
            the day to day life of rural inhabitants. The process for a suitable match is one long and tiring effort,
            which begins with matching some criteria like the horoscope, religion, caste, professional stature, physical
            appearance and culture. It is made sure that majority of the requirements are a 'match made in heaven.

        <h2>Symbols - Fasting</h2>
        <p>Fasting is an integral part of Hindu Culture. Fasts or Vrats or Upvas are a way to represent your sincerity
            and resolve, or express your gratitude to the Gods and Goddesses. People throughout the country observe
            fasts during various religious occasions. Some people also observe fast on different days of a week in
            favour of a particular God or Goddess associated with that specific day. It is widely believed that by doing
            so, you are depriving your body of a basic necessity and thus, punishing yourself to cleanse off the sins
            that you have committed until the day of fast.

            The rules and regulations of a rapid are in accordance with the particular occasion. The origin of fast
            probably comes from the Vedic ritual of kindling the sacrificial fire for sacrifice purposes. Since the word
            'upvas' has been used for denoting both fasts and kindling sacrificial fire, it can be thought that people
            observed fasts when they had to kindle or rekindle the domestic fires kept in their homes to perform daily
            sacrifices.</p>

        <h2>Architecture - The Science Behind Temples</h2>
        <p>the Hindu temple architecture of India is not just the adobe of God, Goddesses and a place of worship; but they are a treasure of knowledge, culture, art, and architecture.Most temples are located along magnetic wave lines of the Earth, which help in maximising the available positive energy. The copper plate (called Garbhagriha or Moolasthan) buried under the main idol absorbs and resonates this energy to its surroundings. Going to the temple often helps in having a positive mind and garnering positive energies, which in turn lead to healthier functioning.

            It is also a practice to take off footwear before entering places of worship because they would bring in the dirt to an otherwise cleansed and sanctified environment.The evolution of India's Hindu temple architecture is marked by a strict adherence to the original ancient models which were derived from religious consideration- and that remained constant over many centuries.</p>

        <h2>Dresses of India - Indian Ethnic Wear</h2>
        <p>Indian women are often seen sporting 'saris'. The sari is a single cloth and needs no stitching; it is easy to make and comfortable to wear, and also adheres to religious etiquette. It initially started as a Hindu tradition but has very elegantly spread across all religions. The same applies to the more functional 'Kurta-Pyjama', and the formal wear of 'Sherwani' for Indian men of all faiths.During festivals and celebrations, people usually turn to their folk dance and traditional dresses. They adorn beautiful dresses that are specific to their state and community. Traditional dresses of Indian states vary from region to region.Textiles have always been an important part of Indian trading. India used to trade with China, Southeast Asia, the Roman Empire, the Arabs, and, during the 17th century, also Europe, in a lucrative exchange of spices and clothing. Printed calicos, chintz, muslins, and patterned silk invaded the English market, and, later on, became a source of pride for the nationalist movement.</p>
